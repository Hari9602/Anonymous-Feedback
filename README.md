## Overview

The FeedbackStorage smart contract is designed to store feedback securely on the blockchain. It allows users to submit feedback anonymously, which is then stored in a structured manner for future reference. This README file provides a detailed explanation of the features and functionality of the FeedbackStorage contract.



## Features

- ### Feedback Structure:
The contract includes a structured format to store each feedback, consisting of the sender's address, the feedback message, and the timestamp when the feedback was submitted.
- ### Adding Feedback:
Users can add feedback by calling the addFeedback function, providing a message as input. This function records the sender's address, the message content, and the timestamp of submission.
- ### Event Emission:
An event FeedbackAdded is emitted each time a new feedback is added. This event includes details such as the sender's address, the feedback message, and the timestamp.
- ### Retrieving Feedback:
The getFeedback function allows users to retrieve a specific feedback by providing its index. This function returns the sender's address, the message content, and the timestamp of the feedback.
- ### Total Feedback Count:
Users can query the total number of feedback entries stored in the contract using the getTotalFeedbacks function. This provides transparency on the volume of feedback stored.
